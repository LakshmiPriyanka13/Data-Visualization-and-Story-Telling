# Superstore Sales Analytics Dashboard – Power BI Project
Welcome to the Superstore Sales Analytics Dashboard project!
This Power BI project explores historical sales data from a retail superstore to generate powerful business insights through interactive visuals, KPIs, and trend analysis.

## Project Objective
This report analyzes historical sales, profit, discounts, and customer segments from the Superstore dataset. The goal is to uncover performance trends, identify high-performing categories and regions, detect discounting inefficiencies, and highlight customer and product segments that drive or drain profitability.

## Dataset Overview
DataSet used - 
The dataset used includes detailed transaction data from a fictional Superstore.
It contains the following key columns:
- Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode
- Product Info: Product ID, Name, Category, Sub-Category
- Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
- Customer Info: Customer ID, Name, Segment, Region, State, City

## Dashboard Overview
I have built a well-structured and insightful dashboard. Here’s a breakdown of each visual and what it delivers:
KPI Cards                           - Snapshot of total sales, profit, quantity, discount
Line Chart                          - Monthly trend of Sales & Profit
Bar Chart(Region)                   - Compare Profit across Regions
Column Chart(Category/Sub-Category) - Identify strong/weak product categories
Bar Chart(Ship Mode)                - Measure profit efficiency per delivery type
Scatter Plot(Discount vs Profit)    - Understand discounting's effect on margins
Segment Comparison                  - Profitability of each customer segment
Slicers                             - Dynamic filtering by Region, Category, Segment, etc

## Key Business Insights
### Sales & Profit Trends
Sales and profit generally follow the same trend, with spikes observed in Q4 months (Nov–Dec), indicating strong seasonal demand.
Dip in profit despite high sales in certain months (likely due to heavy discounting).

### Regional Performance
West and East regions perform well in sales, but the South region has weaker profitability, potentially due to higher discount levels or less efficient shipping.

### Category/Sub-Category Analysis
Technology category drives high sales and profit.
Office Supplies are low-margin, especially products like "Binders" and "Labels" when sold with discounts.

### Discounting Issues
High discount levels (above 30%) lead to negative profit for many sub-categories, especially in Furniture.

### Shipping Mode
Standard Class is the most used mode and also shows better profitability.

### Segment Performance
Corporate customers bring the highest profit, followed by Home Office.
Consumer segment has the highest sales, but is more discount-sensitive and lower in profitability.

## Business Recommendations
- Review discount strategy for Furniture, especially for Tables & Bookcases.
- Reduce discounts above 30%, unless part of a targeted promotion with clear ROI.
- Double down on Technology category — it's your most profitable vertical.
- Consider shipping optimization — shifting more to Second Class could cut costs and improve margins.
- Increase marketing to Corporate customers — they drive stronger profits per sale.
- Investigate South region logistics or pricing strategy to improve profit contribution.
